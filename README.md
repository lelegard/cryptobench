# Cryptographic libraries comparative benchmarks

Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libssl-dev libmbedtls-dev libgnutls28-dev libtomcrypt-dev libtommath-dev libgmp-dev`
- macOS: `brew install openssl mbedtls gnutls libtomcrypt libtommath gmp`

Note: On Ubuntu, the package `libgnutls28-dev` is probably misnamed.
It is the gnutls development environment for the latest versions of gnutls,
3.7.8 as of this writing. It is not (or no longer) gnutls version 2.8.
